<p style="text-align: center;">A typical circular design on a square Delft tile.</p>

<p>Delft is world-famous for its blue and white pottery (also known as <em>Delfts blauw</em>), and the earliest pieces date back to the 16th century.</p>

<p>During a stroll in Delft, Christiaan sees a lot of beautifully painted pottery objects like plates, tiles, and vases in the souvenir shops. Inspired by those, he decides to hand paint such a square tile himself. He has already picked a circular design he wants to place in the middle of the tile. He would like to leave a margin of at least $1 \text{cm}$ around the design. Now, Christiaan just needs to buy a square tile of a suitable size.</p>

<p>Given the area of the circular design, what is the minimum area of the square tile?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One line with an integer $a$ ($1 \leq a\leq 10^{15}$), the area of the circular design in $\text{cm}^2$.</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the minimum area of the square tile in $\text{cm}^2$ that is needed for a design with area $a$ if Christiaan wants to leave a margin of at least $1 \text{cm}$ around the design.</p>

<p>Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-9}$.</p>
